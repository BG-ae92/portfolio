    It's similar to breathing-<br>
    but not right.

    <br>
    <br>

Similar to closing your eyes- <br>
    for good.<br>
    <br>

    A chance that well,<br>

    this could've been it.<br>

    <br>

    At that moment
<br>
        everything around <br>began to flutter.
    <br>


    <br>
   The air spoke in light blue tones all around<br>
    as the white of the sky took over.<br>
    <br>
    A light shined through<br>
    the color orange so sweet, warm.<br>
    <br>
    And in that moment I felt that if left to fate<br>
    things would fall into place.<br>

    <br>
    A net would catch<br>
    to take us away.<br>
        <br>

    We'd end up somwhere <br>
    where darkness never falls<br>
