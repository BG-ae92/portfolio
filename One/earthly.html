        Somewhere in a village<br> a man looks
himself in a mirror.<br>His skin pale,
worn like leather. <br>He raises a hand
to his face<br> where he finds mistrust
<br>in streaks the color cherry.

           <br>
           <br> Light visited him during the early
hours <br>when the sky was still a purplish blue
           <br>
It whispered tales of misfortune
           <br>but nothing on how to stop them.

<br>
           <br>
           Now, as he stares himself
in the mirror <br>the light appears again.
Drifting on-<br>-onto the opposite side,
the man reaches in <br>and finds himself
in a valley of green,<br> spotted brown
    by the summers past.

<br>
        <br>
        Surrounded by those of his same complexion.
<br>He watches in awe
as they all fall
<br>deep between the hills.
<br><br>
The man has seen
past what man can see,
<br>now he is left cold, reflecting
<br>on what it means.
